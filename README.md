# To-Do
I made simple ToDo app with some extra features

With this ToDo site you can add task you need to complete

Once you complete any task you can just cut that task from list

I have used localstorage in it so even if you refresh browser your task remain as it is in list

once you complete all the task you can click on All Done so it will clear all list.
